                        Almost all the games i played at that time was pirated and as you know its not that easy to
                        install a game on your PC. Google became a friend and by fixing things for my needs learnt a

                        after a year , i had a rough idea on Mobiles , hacking in theory and few other tech stuffs.
                        Got better on tech hacks, Mobile and PC mods. This is when i realized mech was not my piece of
                        cake.
