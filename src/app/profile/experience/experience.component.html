                      <p>It all started in grade 10 at St.James HSS, when a friend of mine introduced me to the world of
                        tech with his
                        brand new smartphone. It always amazed me to find how these things work.</p>

                      <p>At this point, i started to make use of the internet in all possible ways, surfing became a
                        passtime and getting to know something was cool.
                        It was the time when you didn't have these much of mobile variants , so i got to know every
                        available phone specs like back of my hand and it felt good.
                        Almost all the games i played at that time was pirated and as you know its not that easy to
                        install a game on your PC. Google became a friend and by fixing things for my needs learnt a
                        lot.</p>

                      <p>I Pursued Mechanical Engineering at KRCE in Trichy. Yea, My dad ws a mechie ,he was my
                        rolemodel so it was a obvious choice ;). Over a period of time developed interest in hacking. So
                        after a year , i had a rough idea on Mobiles , hacking in theory and few other tech stuffs.
                        Got better on tech hacks, Mobile and PC mods. This is when i realized mech was not my piece of
                        cake.

                        tech background it was
                        difficult to get into
                        the IT Sector.
                        Fortunately, got an oppurtunity from a Start-up called <a
